                                    <li>Our customers are very important to us and we want you to be completely satisfied with our service, however, we do have a few rules in place:</li>
                                    <li>We respectfully reserve the right to decline a delivery area that we feel may be unsafe for our signs or our delivery people. This is rare, and we will contact you if this situation arises.</li>
                                    <li>Please do not remove or relocate any of our signs. If you need your display taken down early, please give us a call and we will gladly come and get them.</li>
                                    <li>Missing or damaged lawn display items will be charged to the credit card on file for $10 per flamingo.</li>
                                    <li>We may place a small sign in the yard with our company name, phone number and web address. This sign is unobtrusive and lets the neighbors know how to find us to order a display, so please do not move or hide it.</li>
                                    <li>Please do not let children play on or around the display, or pull up any of the signs. Some of them may look like toys, but they are not. Flock Some1 and its representatives will not be responsible or liable for any injury that may be caused to any person while they are rented and in your recipient’s yard.</li>
                                    <li>We will not, under any circumstances, put up any displays that could be perceived as offensive. Please do not rearrange our displays.</li>
                                    <li>If the recipient calls us and wants to know who ordered the display, we will tell them unless you give us specific instructions not to. We will also take down the display immediately if they request us to do so.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li>We will gladly reschedule the delivery or reimburse you 100% if you need to cancel, but you must give us at least 48 hours notice. A lot of time and planning goes into your display leading up to it so a 48 hour notice is required for a refund.</li>
                                    <li>In the event of inclement weather, we will not be able to set up any lawn displays. If this occurs, we will promptly refund the full rental price. Inclement weather includes lightning, thunderstorms, heavy snow, ice (severe frozen yard), high wind and any other Act of God that would put us or our lawn display in danger. Please know that it must be severe weather for us to miss a delivery. Rain will never be the cause of a cancellation, and the wind must be severe enough to impact the stability of the signs.</li>
                                    <li>The items we cannot refund you for include:</li>
                                    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px; padding: 20px; line-height: 24px;">
                                        <li>If an incorrect delivery address is provided. We will send you a confirmation of your order via email so please DOUBLE CHECK the address, delivery date and time to make sure there won’t be any problems. We will make every effort to contact you if a problem arises as your satisfaction is very important to us.</li>
                                        <li>If your recipient wants the display removed promptly.</li>
                                        <li>If we are not allowed access to a gated community. Please let the community guard know the date we will be arriving, or provide us with the gate access code if required.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <li>Every attempt will be made to make you a completely satisfied customer. We want you to be a repeat customer and to tell all of your friends about us!</li>
